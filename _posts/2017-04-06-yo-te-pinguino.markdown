I don't really remember when I fell in love with penguin. But it is obvious that I really love penguin now. They are so cute and cool, which is the hardest to be. And that's simply what I say to my friend Fannits. "Yo te pinguino!"

## Extension of the usage "yo te pinguino!"
I am always pretty panic whenever I start use a new program. To be more honest, I've never succeeded to set a new project at once. That simply frustrated me a lot. It happened to me today, as usual, when I creat this simple web-page. Can you imagine the fear I felt in even before the first step?

YES. It happened, obviously. I tried it till 2am last night as well. ERRORS. UNKNOWN ERRORS. EVERY SINGLE STEP. I nearly gave it up. However, all my classmates started comment to the endless questions about the error-point that I was struggling with. THEY ARE THE BEST LIONS EVER. 

>YO LES PINGUINO! 

Those issues what I solved with them.

* Theme apply
* Initiating a new repo issue
* Other relative issues
* Cheering me up never to give up

How can I express all bless that I could feel because of you guys... I will never forget this and keep encouraging you till we all find a perfect position!!! You can do whatever I can do!!!

SIEMPRE YO LES PINGUINO Y NO LES OLVIDARE (con tilde :)
